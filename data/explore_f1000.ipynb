A link to download the samples is provided in the manuscript herein. This data descriptor further explains how and why these fetal MRI samples were selected. Firstly, thousands of cross-sectional images obtained from fetal MRI scans were processed and sorted semi-manually with other software. We did so because a built-in “samplesort” (sorting algorithm) is missing in MaZda version 5. Additionally, the software is unfortunately lacking effective and efficient algorithms to allow automatic identification and segmentation of anatomical structures in fetal MRI samples. Hence, the finals sorting steps were carried out manually via time-consuming methods — i.e. human- visual detection and classifications by the gestational age of pregnancy and the rotational plane of the MR scanner. Thus the latter correlates with the anatomical plane of the mother, rather than the hypothetical plane used to transect the fetus. In brief, we collated these fetal MRI samples in an effort to facilitate future research and discovery, especially to aid the improvement of MaZda.',\n",

The authors may consider enlarging its audience size by introducing how this data could benefit other researchers in the fetal research community. \\nThe sample sorting seems totally manual, which may be more efficient with the help of some machine learning algorithms. \\nExperiments could be added to evaluate the performance/correctness of the sample sorting process. \\nSome details of the data itself could be useful for readers, such as the final data number, demographic information. The dataset 1 for downloading seem only contain 3 subjects. \\nAre sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others? \\nPartly \"\n",

      "         \"main\": \"To my understanding this manuscript provides a description of a data repository containing fetal MR scans and a description of an analysis software package. This is a very nice idea. However, the manuscript is currently not clearly written which hampers reading and understanding of the paper. In my opinion the purpose of the paper needs to be clarified. Description of the data repository can be more concise, and description of collected images could be more specific. It is good that patient inclusion is provided but it would be nice to know how many images acquired with what protocol are collected, as well as the patient characteristics. \\nFurthermore, exact purpose of the software is currently unclear. Reading descriptions available at provided links provides some clarification but it would be much better if this manuscript is self-contained. \\nThe manuscript contains many specific terms that are to the best of my knowledge not generally known and hence need to be introduced and explained to allow understanding of the work. For example, the introduction starts with \\u201csample sorting\\u201d which is not introduced. In the same paragraph, the authors mention \\u201ctarget recognition semantics\\u201d but it is not known what is meant by this. \\nThe authors mention that personal information has been removed according to agreement, but it is not clear what agreement. \\nIt would be important to describe in the manuscript if and how scientific community can benefit from this image database and the described software. \\nThe title does not reflect the content of the paper well. I would advise to change it accordingly. \\nAre sufficient details of methods and materials provided to allow replication by others? \\nNo \"\n",

      "            <p>This review article addresses the post-operative management of a relatively new technique for valve replacement. The topic is important and the authors nicely review the range of possible post-operative complications.</p>\n",
      "            <p>I have a few small concerns. The first is that the majority of the topics covered are applicable to all cardiac surgery patients. I think it would be helpful for the authors to highlight better which are the issues that are truly specific to these patients (i.e. retroperitoneal hematoma, and possible management of severe COPD) and which are general to valve surgery (e.g. risk of stroke).</p>\n",
      "            <p>Second, there are a number of statements that should either be changed, or referenced:</p>\n",
      "            <p>-There should be references for the two delirium screening systems described.&#x00a0;</p>\n",
      "            <p>-The authors state that haloperidol has a &#x201c;proven success record for mgmt. of delirium&#x201d;. &#x00a0;I am not aware of good studies that prove this; it should either be referenced or removed.</p>\n",
      "            <p>-Studies on prophylaxis for delirium are conflicted. The statement in the paper implies that prophylaxis should be standard of care in hospitals. I suggest tempering this statement.</p>\n",
      "            <p>-&#x201c;Epidural anesthesia is the current standard of care&#x201d; either should be referenced or removed, as, again, this implies that physicians who are not supplying epidurals to these patients are failing to provide appropriate care.</p>\n",
      "            <p>-&#x201c;Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) may be used, or aspirin and warfarin if a patient is already taking warfarin for concomitant atrial fibrillation&#x201d; should be referenced, or it should be made clear that there are no guidelines and this is purely the opinion of the authors.</p>\n",
      "            <p>-&#x201c;We believe targeting a mean arterial pressure of 60&#x2013;80 is reasonable,&#x201d; would also benefit from a reference, or perhaps include some additional caveat regarding taking into account a patient&#x2019;s preoperative blood pressure.&#x00a0;</p>\n",
      "            <p>-Second paragraph on renal failure &#x2013; data &#x201c;are&#x201d; plural. Currently says &#x201c;data is&#x201d;</p>\n",
